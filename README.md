+ **Frogger** - Get your frog across the river and lanes of traffic by either jumping on logs and lily pads rushing by at different speeds or avoid the automobiles which are also moving at various speeds. Based on the old arcade game.

## Classic Algorithms

+ **Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

+ **Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

+ **Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

+ **Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).

## Graphs

+ **Graph from links** - Create a program that will create a graph or network from a series of links.

+ **Eulerian Path** - Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible. A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph through every node and finishes at another node. A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.

+ **Connected Graph** - Create a program which takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or not.

+ **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.

+ **Inverted index** - An [Inverted Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term/terms. The search index can be in memory.
